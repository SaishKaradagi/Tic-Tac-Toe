# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s designed to help users play the game in their web browser with basic turn-based gameplay, win detection, and sound effects.

## Overview

I developed this project as part of my learning journey in **JavaScript**. The goal was to create a fun, interactive web game that demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic. This project also introduced me to the use of audio elements and animations to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Turn-based gameplay**: Players alternate between "X" and "O".
- **Win detection**: Automatically checks for a winner when a player wins.
- **Reset button**: Resets the game and allows players to start a new match.
- **Animated winning line**: Visual effect when a player wins the game.
- **Sound effects**: Includes sound for each player’s turn and for game over events.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure for the game layout and grid.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the game grid, buttons, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, player turns, win detection, and event listeners.
- **Audio**: Background music and sound effects in `.mp3` format.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tic-tac-toe.git
2. 2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

    The game should load in the browser, and you can begin playing.
## How to Play

1. The game starts with player "X".
2. Players take turns clicking an empty box on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
3. The game will automatically check for a winner once a player places their mark. A winning combination (three in a row) will be displayed with an animated line.
4. The **Reset** button can be clicked to start a new game.

## Learning Outcome

Through building this project, I learned how to:

- Manage game states in JavaScript.
- Handle user interactions through event listeners.
- Use DOM manipulation to update the game interface dynamically.
- Integrate audio elements to enhance the gameplay experience.
- Implement animations using CSS for visual effects like the winning line.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of my learning in JavaScript. I used external resources for sound effects and the GIF image. Special thanks to all the tutorials and documentation that helped me along the way!
